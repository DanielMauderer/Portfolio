      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        The Gameserver Manager is a project that I started to manage my game
        servers. At that time I had a few game servers running on a dedicated
        server. I wanted to give easy access to me and my friends to start,
        stop, and backup these servers. To accive this the nodes create a
        different docker container for each game server. This allows for easy
        resource management and backup creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project can be split into three sections. The website that is
        delivered to the client. A REST-API that is used by the website to
        communicate to the nodes. And the nodes that are connected with the
        local docker daemon to manage the game servers containers. The api can
        connect to multiple nodes this allows for easy horizontal scaling of the
        system.

      <p>
        The website is build with Vue and TypeScript. The design is keeped very
        simple to allow for easy use. It requests all data from the REST-API
        that is build with ASP.Net. The API handles user permissions and hides
        the nodes from the client. The nodes are build with C# and use gRPC to
        communicate with the API. Each node needs to have docker running to host
        the game servers.

        This Code snippet shows the proto file that is used to generate the gRPC
        code. These file defines all functions that are used to control and
        fetch data from the nodes. With Get and GetAll the API can gather all
        servers running on that node.

        The Code above shows the Type used by the Import function. The Import

        The Start, Stop and Update functions are used to controlle the
        container. When creating the container it is possible to define a start,
        stop and update bash script. These scripts are executed when the API
        calls the corresponding function.
