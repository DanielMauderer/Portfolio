      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project is a simple point generator to learn some SIMD and OpenCL
        programming. A friend of mine is learning programming and writes a small
        space strategy game. For this game he needs to generate a large number
        of points. I thought it would be a good idea to write a small program
        that generates these points to learn SIMD and GPU programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program generates the points with an expotential distribution
        distance to the center. For easy generation points are generated in a
        spherical coordinate system. And for later computation converted to
        Cartesian coordinates.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to optimize this problem in three steps. The first one is a
        simple sequential implementation as a benchmark for the other two
        implementations. The second one uses SIMD instructions to calculate
        multiple points at once. The third one uses OpenCL to calculate all the
        points simultaneous on the GPU.

      <h3>Point generation</h3>
      <p>
        Every point has Theta Phi and a radius. Both the radius and phi are
        genenerated with a expotential distribution. The Sign of phi is randomly
        flipped to get a angle between -PI and PI. The Theta is generated with a
        uniform distribution. To convert the spherical coordinates to cartesian
        coordinates the following formulas are used:

      <h3>Single instruction multiple data</h3>
      <p>
        The SIMD implementation is very similar to the sequential
        implementation. The Points are generated in batches, depending on the
        CPU.
      </p>
      <pre><code [highlightAuto]="simdDefinition" lineNumbers></code></pre>
      <p>
        The code defines three vectors each vector holds one part of the
        coordinates. The f32x64 type holds 64 32bit floating point numbers. This
        makes it possible to calculate 64 points at once.
      </p>

      <h3>GPU accelerated</h3>
      <p>
        To calculate the points effitiently using the GPU I changed the flow how
        I generate the points.

      <p>
        To minimize the data transfer between the CPU and the GPU a seed vector
        is generated. Each seed belongs to a different point. With this seed the
        GPU generates random starting points for the radius, Theta and Phi.
      </p>
      <pre><code [highlight]="openClKernel" language="c" lineNumbers></code></pre>
      <p>
        The majority of the time is spent allocating the memory and copying the
        data to and from the GPU. Because the calculation is very simple
        compared to the amount of data produced this is expected.
