      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project is a simple point generator to learn some SIMD and OpenCL
        programming. A friend of mine is learning programming and writes a small
        space strategy game. For this game he needs to generate a large number
        of points. I thought it would be a good idea to write a small program
        that generates these points to learn SIMD and GPU programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program generates the points with an expotential distribution
        distance to the center. For easy generation points are generated in a
        spherical coordinate system. And for later computation converted to
        Cartesian coordinates.

      <h3>Point generation</h3>
      <p>
        Every point has Theta Phi and a radius. Both the radius and phi are
        genenerated with a expotential distribution. The Sign of phi is randomly
        flipped to get a angle between -PI and PI. The Theta is generated with a
        uniform distribution. To convert the spherical coordinates to cartesian
        coordinates the following formulas are used:
